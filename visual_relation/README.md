# Visual Relation Tutorial
In this tutorial, we show how Snorkel can be applied to an image classification task.
We consider the task of identifying visual relationships such as `riding` and `carrying` between objects in an image.
We use categorical and spatial intuition about how objects in a visual relationship interact with each other to create labeling functions, and then use a label model to obtain high quality training labels for training a deep neural network to perform the task.
