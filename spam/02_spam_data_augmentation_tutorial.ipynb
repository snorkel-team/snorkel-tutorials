    "## 2. Writing Transformation Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Transformation Functions are functions that can be applied to a training example to create another valid training example. For example, for image classification problems, it is common to rotate or crop images in the training data to create new training inputs. Transformation functions should be atomic e.g. a small rotation of an image, or changing a single word in a sentence. We then compose multiple transformation functions when applying them to training examples.\n",

Some [common](https://towardsdatascience.com/data-augmentation-in-nlp-2801a34dfc28) [ways](https://towardsdatascience.com/these-are-the-easiest-data-augmentation-techniques-in-natural-language-processing-you-can-think-of-88e393fd610) to augment text includes replacing words with their synonyms, or replacing names entities with other entities. Applying these operations to a comment shouldn't change whether it is `SPAM` or not.\n",

A `policy` is used to determine what sequence of TFs to apply to each example. In this case, we just use a `MeanFieldPolicy` that picks 2 TFs at random per example, with probabilities given by `p`. We give higher probabilities to the replace_X_with_synonym TFs, since those provide more information to the model. The `n_per_original` argument determines how many augmented examples to generate per original example."
