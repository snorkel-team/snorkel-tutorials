    "In this tutorial, we will walk through the process of using Snorkel to build a training set for classifying YouTube comments as spam or not spam.\n",
    "The goal of this tutorial is to illustrate the basic components and concepts of Snorkel in a simple way, but also to dive into the actual process of iteratively developing real applications in Snorkel.\n",
    "\n",
    "* For an overview of Snorkel, visit [snorkel.org](https://snorkel.org)\n",
    "* You can also check out the [Snorkel API documentation](https://snorkel.readthedocs.io/)\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to train a classifier over the comment data that can predict whether a comment is spam or not spam.\n",
    "We have access to a large amount of *unlabeled data* in the form of YouTube comments with some metadata.\n",
    "In order to train a classifier, we need to label our data, but doing so by hand for real world applications can be prohibitively slow and expensive, often taking person-weeks or months.\n",
    "\n",
    "We therefore turn to weak supervision using **_labeling functions (LFs)_**: noisy, programmatic rules and heuristics that assign labels to unlabeled training data.\n",
    "We'll dive into the Snorkel API and how we write labeling functions later in this tutorial, but as an example,\n",
    "we can write an LF that labels data points with `\"http\"` in the comment text as spam since many spam\n",
    "comments contain links:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from snorkel.labeling import labeling_function\n",
    "\n",
    "@labeling_function()\n",
    "def lf_contains_link(x):\n",
    "    # Return a label of SPAM if \"http\" in comment text, otherwise ABSTAIN\n",
    "    return SPAM if \"http\" in x.text.lower() else ABSTAIN\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The tutorial is divided into four parts:\n",
    "1. **Loading Data**: We load a [YouTube comments dataset](http://www.dt.fee.unicamp.br/~tiago//youtubespamcollection/), originally introduced in [\"TubeSpam: Comment Spam Filtering on YouTube\"](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7424299/), ICMLA'15 (T.C. Alberto, J.V. Lochter, J.V. Almeida).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Writing Labeling Functions**: We write Python programs that take as input a data point and assign labels (or abstain) using heuristics, pattern matching, and third-party models.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Combining Labeling Function Outputs with the Label Model**: We use the outputs of the labeling functions over the training set as input to the label model, which assigns probabilistic labels to the training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Training a Classifier**: We train a classifier that can predict labels for *any* YouTube comment (not just the ones labeled by the labeling functions) using the probabilistic training labels from step 3."

    "\n",
    "We split our data into 4 sets:\n",
    "* **Training Set**: The largest split of the dataset, and the one without ground truth (\"gold\") labels.\n",
    "We will generate labels for these data points with weak supervision.\n",
    "* \\[Optional\\] **Development Set**: A small labeled subset of the training data (e.g. 100 points) to guide LF development. See note below.\n",
    "* **Validation Set**: A small labeled set used to tune hyperparameters while training the classifier.\n",
    "* **Test Set**: A labeled set for final evaluation of our classifier. This set should only be used for final evaluation, _not_ error analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "While it is possible to develop labeling functions on the unlabeled training set only, users often find it more time-efficient to label a small dev set to provide a quick approximate signal on the accuracies and failure modes of their LFs (rather than scrolling through training data points and mentally assessing approximate accuracy).\n",
    "Alternatively, users sometimes will have the validation set also serve as the development set.\n",
    "Do the latter only with caution: because the labeling functions will be based on data points from the validation set, the validation set will no longer be an unbiased proxy for the test set."

    "However, as we can clearly see by looking the summary statistics of our LFs in the previous section, they are not all equally accurate, and should not be treated identically. In addition to having varied accuracies and coverages, LFs may be correlated, resulting in certain signals being overrepresented in a majority-vote-based model. To handle these issues appropriately, we will instead use a more sophisticated Snorkel `LabelModel` to combine the outputs of the LFs.\n",
    "\n",
    "This model will ultimately produce a single set of noise-aware training labels, which are probabilistic or confidence-weighted labels. We will then use these labels to train a classifier for our task. For more technical details of this overall approach, see our [NeurIPS 2016](https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07723) and [AAAI 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.02840) papers.

    "\n",
    "Note that no gold labels are used during the training process.\n",
    "The only information we need is the label matrix, which contains the output of the LFs on our training set.\n",
    "The `LabelModel` is able to learn weights for the labeling functions using only the label matrix as input.\n",

    "The `LabelModel` trains much more quickly than typical discriminative models since we only need the label matrix as input."

    "We can also use tools in Ludwig to visualize the training curves from the model run logs -- just load up the `.json` file with the training statistics, and run a quick visualization function as below.  Note that the validation and training loss track each other, indicating that this model likely has not overfit.  The accessibility of such common diagnostics is an advantage of focusing on model supervision, and letting modern deep learning software handle the model training procedures."
