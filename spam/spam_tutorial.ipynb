    "In this tutorial, we will walk through the process of using `Snorkel` to classify YouTube comments as `SPAM` or `HAM` (not spam).\n",
    "For an overview of Snorkel, visit [snorkel.org](http://snorkel.org).\n",
    "You can also check out the [Snorkel API documentation](https://snorkel.readthedocs.io/).\n",
    "\n",
    "For our task, we have access to a large amount of *unlabeled data*, which can be prohibitively expensive and slow to label manually.\n",
    "We therefore turn to weak supervision using **_labeling functions_**, or noisy, programmatic heuristics, to assign labels to unlabeled training data efficiently.\n",
    "We also have access to a small amount of labeled data, which we only use for evaluation purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tutorial is divided into four parts:\n",
    "1. **Loading Data**: We load a [YouTube comments dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/goneee/youtube-spam-classifiedcomments) from Kaggle.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Writing Labeling Functions**: We write Python programs that take as input a data point and assign labels (or abstain) using heuristics, pattern matching, and third-party models.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Combining Weak Labels with the Label Model**: We use the outputs of the labeling functions over the training set as input to the label model, which assings probabilistic labels to the training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Training a Classifier**: We train a classifier that can predict labels for *any* YouTube comment (not just the ones labeled by the labeling functions) using the probabilistic training labels from step 3."

    "\n",
    "* **`SPAM`**: irrelevant or inappropriate messages, or\n",
    "* **`HAM`**: comments relevant to the video\n",
    "\n",

    "### Data Splits in Snorkel\n",
    "\n",
    "We split our data into 4 sets:\n",
    "* **Training Set**: The largest split of the dataset. We do not have ground truth or \"gold\" labels for these data points; we will be generating their labels with weak supervision.\n",
    "* \\[Optional\\] **Development Set**: A small labeled subset of the training data (e.g. 100 points) to guide LF iteration. See note below.\n",
    "* **Validation Set**: A labeled set used to tune hyperparameters and/or perform early stopping while training the classifier.\n",
    "* **Test Set**: A labeled set for final evaluation of our classifier. This set should only be used for final evaluation, _not_ error analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "While it is possible to develop labeling functions on the unlabeled training set only, users often find it more time-efficient to label a small dev set to provide a quick approximate signal on the accuracies and failure modes of their LFs (rather than scrolling through training examples and mentally assessing approximate accuracy).\n",
    "Alternatively, users sometimes will have the validation set also serve as the development set.\n",
    "Do the latter only with caution: because the labeling functions will be based on examples from the validation set, the validation set will no longer be an unbiased proxy for the test set."

    "**Labeling functions (LFs) help users encode domain knowledge and other supervision sources programmatically.**\n",
    "\n",
    "LFs are heuristics that take as input a data point and either assign a label to it (in this case, `HAM` or `SPAM`) or abstain (don't assign any label). Labeling functions can be *noisy*: they don't have perfect accuracy and don't have to label every data point.\n",
    "Moreover, different labeling functions can overlap (label the same data point) and even conflict (assign different labels to the same data point). This is expected, and we demonstrate how we deal with this later.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because their only requirement is that they map a data point a label (or abstain), they can wrap a wide variety of forms of supervision. Examples include, but are not limited to:\n",
    "* *Keyword searches*: looking for specific words in a sentence\n",
    "* *Pattern matching*: looking for specific syntactical patterns\n",
    "* *Third-party models*: using an pre-trained model (usually a model for a different task than the one at hand)\n",
    "* *Distant supervision*: using external knowledge base\n",
    "* *Crowdworker labels*: treating each crowdworker as a black-box function that assigns labels to subsets of the data\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of **developing LFs** is iterative and usually consists of:\n",
    "* Writing a function\n",
    "* Estimating its performance by looking at labeled examples in the training set or dev set\n",
    "* Iterating to improve coverage or accuracy as necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Balancing accuracy and coverage for specific labeling functions as well as the overall set of LFs developed is often a trade-off, and depending on the use case, users may tend to prefer one over the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once multiple LFs have been created, users can look at data points that have received no labels so far (or many conflicting labels) to get ideas for new LFs to write.\n",
    "Furthermore, if there are some classes that have votes from very few LFs, users might iterate by writing additional LFs to cover those parts of the dataset.\n",
    "**Note, however, that it is not necessary for LFs to assign labels to every data point;** in fact, most of the time your LFs will not have perfect dataset-wide coverage.\n",
    "We rely on the fact that the classifier that trains on labels from Snorkel has the power to _generalize_ and can therefore learn a good representation of the data even if the each data point in the training set does not receive a label from any LFs.\n",
    "In addition, note that **it is ok to have overlaps and conflicts between labeling functions**. For example, two good labeling functions can conflict when one of them is written to fix the errors of the other. We later use a _label model_ that learns how to combine the outputs of all (potentially conflicting) labeling functions to estimate label probabilities."

    "However, as we can clearly see by looking the summary statistics of our LFs in the previous section, they are not all equally accurate, and should ideally not be treated identically. In addition to having varied accuracies and coverages, LFs may be correlated, resulting in certain signals being overrepresented in a majority-vote-based model. To handle these issues appropriately, we will instead use a more sophisticated Snorkel `LabelModel` to combine our weak labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "This model will ultimately produce a single set of noise-aware training labels, which are probabilistic or confidence-weighted labels. We will then use these labels to train a classifier for our task. For more technical details of this overall approach, see our [NeurIPS 2016](https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07723) and [AAAI 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.02840) papers.

    "\n",
    "Note that no gold labels are used during the training process.\n",
