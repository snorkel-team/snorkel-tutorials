## Tutorials
We recommend that all users **start with the [Getting Started](https://snorkel.org/get-started/) tutorial hosted on the Snorkel website** for a gentle introduction to the concepts and classes of Snorkel.
All other tutorials assume that you have already completed that tutorial and are familiar with its concepts.
After that, the `spam` directory contains three tutorials introducing labeling functions, transformation functions, and slicing functions, respectively.
The rest of the tutorials explore other tasks, techniques, and integrations.

The Snorkel tutorials are grouped by application:
* [`spam`](https://github.com/snorkel-team/snorkel-tutorials/blob/master/spam/README.md): Is this YouTube comment spam?
* [`spouse`](https://github.com/snorkel-team/snorkel-tutorials/blob/master/spouse/README.md): Does this sentence imply that the two marked people are spouses?
* [`visual_relation`](https://github.com/snorkel-team/snorkel-tutorials/blob/master/visual_relation/README.md): Is object A riding object B in the image, carrying it, or neither?
* [`crowdsourcing`](https://github.com/snorkel-team/snorkel-tutorials/blob/master/crowdsourcing/README.md): Is this tweet about the weather expressing a positive, negative or neutral sentiment?
* [`multitask`](https://github.com/snorkel-team/snorkel-tutorials/blob/master/multitask/README.md) (Multi-Task Learning): A synthetic task demonstrating the native Snorkel multi-task classifier API
* [`recsys`](https://github.com/snorkel-team/snorkel-tutorials/blob/master/recsys/README.md) (Recommender Systems): Will this user read and like this book?
* [`drybell`](https://github.com/snorkel-team/snorkel-tutorials/blob/master/drybell/README.md): Is a celebrity mentioned in this news article?

Here we provide an index pointing to different available tutorials by their task type, techniques, and integrations.

## Getting Started

Step one is cloning this repo.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/snorkel-team/snorkel-tutorials.git
cd snorkel-tutorials
```

As with Snorkel, our tutorials require Python 3.6+.
If you're looking to quickly get started with a tutorial, we recommend using
our [Docker setup](#docker).
If you want to install things yourself using `pip` or `conda`, you can follow
our [installation steps](#install) below instead.

***Snorkel version***

This tutorials repo is pinned to a specific version of the Snorkel library,
which is specified in the
[requirements file](https://github.com/snorkel-team/snorkel-tutorials/blob/master/requirements.txt).
Note that this will likely not be up to date with the `master` branch in
the main Snorkel repo.
We recommend using virtual environments or Docker containers to run the
tutorials, so check out the details below.

***A quick note for Windows users***

If you're using Windows, we highly recommend using the [Docker setup](#docker)
or the [Linux subsystem](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/faq).
It can be tricky to get the installation right using application-specific shells
(e.g. the `conda` shell).
Additionally, the shell scripts included in this repo (such as those for
downloading datasets) use \*nix-style commands.


### <a name="docker"> Running with Docker </a>

We've included a Docker setup for our tutorials to make setup easy.
First, make sure you have [Docker installed](https://docs.docker.com/install/) on your machine.
To build and run a Docker image for a tutorial, use `scripts/docker_launch.py` with the `--build` flag.
For example, run the following for the `spam` tutorial:

```bash
python3 scripts/docker_launch.py spam --build
```

Building a Docker image from scratch can take anywhere between 5 and
30 minutes depending on the machine you're using.
We're working on making prebuilt images available via DockerHub.

Once the image has been built, a Jupyter notebook server will be available
on port 8888 (you can change the port with the `--port` command line option)
and print out a link you can follow to access the browser interface.
In your browser, open a `.ipynb` file you would like to run &mdash;
such as `01_spam_tutorial.ipynb` &mdash; and execute the cells in sequence.

Once you've built a tutorial-specific image for the first time,
you can run it without the `--build` flag:

```bash
python3 scripts/docker_launch.py spam
```

### <a name="install"> Installing yourself </a>

Running a tutorial has three required steps if you're installing yourself:

1. Installing repo-wide requirements
1. Installing tutorial-specific requirements
1. Launching a Jupyter notebook server or executing as a script

We recommend installing requirements in a virtual environment using [`virtualenv`](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) or [`conda`](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/).

The following example commands show you how to install the requirements for the
`spam` tutorial, then launch a notebook server to run the tutorial.
To run a different tutorial, simply replace `spam` with the desired directory.

<details><summary><b>Installing with <tt>pip</tt></b></summary>
<p>

These commands assume that your Python version is 3.6+ and that the Python 3
version of `pip` is available as `pip3`.
It may be available as `pip` depending on how your system is configured.

```bash
# [OPTIONAL] Activate a virtual environment
pip3 install --upgrade virtualenv
virtualenv -p python3 .envspam
source .envspam/bin/activate

# Install requirements (both shared and tutorial-specific)
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
pip3 install -r spam/requirements.txt

# Launch the Jupyter notebook interface (making sure the right virtual environment is used)
.envspam/bin/jupyter notebook spam
```

</p>
</details>


<details><summary><b>Installing with <tt>conda</tt></b></summary>
<p>

These commands assume that your conda installation is Python 3.6+.

```bash
# [OPTIONAL] Activate a virtual environment
conda create --yes -n spam python=3.6
conda activate spam

# Install requirements (both shared and tutorial-specific)
pip install environment_kernels
# We specify PyTorch here to ensure compatibility, but it may not be necessary.
conda install pytorch==1.1.0 -c pytorch
conda install snorkel==0.9.5 -c conda-forge
pip install -r spam/requirements.txt

# Launch the Jupyter notebook interface
jupyter notebook spam
```

Make sure to select the right kernel (`conda_spam`) when running the jupyter notebook.

</p>
</details>

Then in the browser tab that opens, navigate to a `.ipynb` file you would like
to run &mdash; such as `01_spam_tutorial.ipynb` &mdash; and execute the
cells in sequence.

Alternatively, you can run the tutorial as a script by calling `python3` on the corresponding `.py` file directly (e.g. `python3 spam/01_spam_tutorial.py`).
The `.py` source files are written in [Jupytext `percent` format](https://jupytext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), and contain the same content as the notebooks.
