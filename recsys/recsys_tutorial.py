# # Recommender Systems Tutorial
# In this tutorial, we'll provide a simple walkthrough of how to use Snorkel to build a recommender system.
# We consider a setting similar to the [Netflix challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/netflix-inc/netflix-prize-data), but with books instead of movies.
# We have a set of users and books, and for each user we know the set of books they have interacted with (read or marked as to-read).
# We don't have the user's numerical ratings for the books they read, except in a small number of cases.
# We also have some text reviews written by users.
#
# Our goal is to build a recommender system by training a classifier to predict whether a user will read and like any given book.
# We'll train our model over a user-book pair to predict a `rating` (a `rating` of 1 means the user will read and like the book).
# To simplify inference, we'll represent a user by the set of books they interacted with (rather than learning a specific representation for each user).
# Once we have this model trained, we can use it to recommend books to a user when they visit the site.
# For example, we can just predict the rating for the user paired with a book for a few thousand likely books, then pick the books with the top ten predicted ratings.
#
# Of course, there are many other ways to approach this problem.
# The field of [recommender systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recommender_system) is a very well studied area with a wide variety of settings and approaches, and we just focus on one of them.
#
# We will use the [Goodreads](https://sites.google.com/eng.ucsd.edu/ucsdbookgraph/home) dataset, from
# "Item Recommendation on Monotonic Behavior Chains", RecSys'18 (Mengting Wan, Julian McAuley), and "Fine-Grained Spoiler Detection from Large-Scale Review Corpora", ACL'19 (Mengting Wan, Rishabh Misra, Ndapa Nakashole, Julian McAuley).
# In this dataset, we have user interactions and reviews for Young Adult novels from the Goodreads website, along with metadata (like `title` and `authors`) for the novels.

# ## Loading Data

# %% [markdown]
# We start by running the `download_and_process_data` function.
# The function returns the `df_train`, `df_test`, `df_dev`, `df_valid` dataframes, which correspond to our training, test, development, and validation sets.
# Each of those dataframes has the following fields:
# * `user_idx`: A unique identifier for a user.
# * `book_idx`: A unique identifier for a book that is being rated by the user.
# * `book_idxs`: The set of books that the user has interacted with (read or planned to read).
# * `review_text`: Optional text review written by the user for the book.
# * `rating`: Either `0` (which means the user did not read or did not like the book) or `1` (which means the user read and liked the book). The `rating` field is missing for `df_train`.
# Our objective is to predict whether a given user (represented by the set of book_idxs the user has interacted with) will read and like any given book.
# That is, we want to train a model that takes a set of `book_idxs` (the user) and a single `book_idx` (the book to rate) and predicts the `rating`.
#
# In addition, `download_and_process_data` also returns the `df_books` dataframe, which contains one row per book, along with metadata for that book (such as `title` and `first_author`).

# We look at a sample of the labeled development set.
# As an example, we want our final recommendations model to be able to predict that a user who has interacted with `book_idxs` (25743, 22318, 7662, 6857, 83, 14495, 30664, ...) would either not read or not like the book with `book_idx` 22764 (first row), while a user who has interacted with `book_idxs` (3880, 18078, 9092, 29933, 1511, 8560, ...) would read and like the book with `book_idx` 3181 (second row).

# ### Rating Prediction Model
# We write a Keras model for predicting ratings given a user's book list and a book (which is being rated).
# The model represents the list of books the user interacted with, `books_idxs`, by learning an embedding for each idx, and averaging the embeddings in `book_idxs`.
# It learns another embedding for the `book_idx`, the book to be rated.
# Then it concatenates the two embeddings and uses an [MLP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilayer_perceptron) to compute the probability of the `rating` being 1.
# This type of model is common in large-scale recommender systems, for example, the [YouTube recommender system](https://ai.google/research/pubs/pub45530).

# We use triples of (`book_idxs`, `book_idx`, `rating`) from our dataframes as training data points. In addition, we want to train the model to recognize when a user will not read a book. To create data points for that, we randomly sample a `book_id` not in `book_idxs` and use that with a `rating` of 0 as a _random negative_ data point. We create one such _random negative_ data point for every positive (`rating` 1) data point in our dataframe so that positive and negative data points are roughly balanced.

# ## Summary
#
# In this tutorial, we showed one way to use Snorkel for recommendations.
# We used book metadata and review text to create LFs that estimate user ratings.
# We used Snorkel's `LabelModel` to combine the outputs of those LFs.
# Finally, we trained a model to predict whether a user will read and like a given book (and therefore what books should be recommended to the user) based only on what books the user has interacted with in the past.
#
# Here we demonstrated one way to use Snorkel for training a recommender system.
# Note, however, that this approach could easily be adapted to take advantage of additional information as it is available (e.g., user profile data, denser user ratings, and so on.)
