# # Multi-Task Learning (MTL) Basics Tutorial

# %% [markdown]
# Multi-task learning, or training a single model on multiple tasks, is becoming a standard tool for the modern ML practioner (see Ruder's [survey](http://ruder.io/multi-task/) from 2017 for a nice overview).
# It often leads to computational gains (one model performing many tasks takes up less memory and storage) as well as performance gains (learning to do well on a related _auxiliary_ task can improve the model's ability on the _primary_ task).
#
# While the primary purpose of the Snorkel project is to support training data creation and management, it also comes with a PyTorch-based modeling framework intended to support flexible multi-task learning (e.g. [slice-aware models](https://snorkel.org/use-cases/03-spam-data-slicing-tutorial).
# Using this particular framework (as opposed to other excellent third party libraries) is entirely optional, but we have found it helpful in our own work and so provide it here.
# In particular, because MTL in general often requires easily *adding new datasets, tasks, and metrics* (and just as easily removing them), each of these concepts has been decoupled in the snorkel MTL classifier.

# %% [markdown]
# ### Tutorial Overview

# %% [markdown]
# The purpose of this tutorial is to introduce the basic interfaces and flow of multi-task learning tools within Snorkel.
# We assume that you have prior experience with MTL, so we don't motivate or explain multi-task learning at large here.
#
# In this notebook, we will start by looking at a simple MTL model with only two tasks, each having distinct data and only one set of ground truth labels ("gold" labels). We'll also use a simple dataset where the raw data is directly usable as features, for simplicity (i.e., unlike text data, where we would first need to tokenize and transform the data into token ids).
# At the end, you'll fill in the missing details to add a third task to the model.

# ## Create Toy Data

# %% [markdown]
# We'll now create a toy dataset to work with.
# Our data points are 2D points in a square centered on the origin.
# Our tasks will be classifying whether these points are:
#
# 1. Inside a **unit circle** centered on the origin (label 0 = `False`, label 1 = `True`)
# 2. Inside a **unit square** centered on the origin (label 0 = `False`, label 1 = `True`)

# %% [markdown] {"tags": ["md-exclude"]}
# We'll visualize these decision boundaries in a few cells.

# %% [markdown]
# _Note: We don't expect these specific toy tasks to necessarily improve one another, but this is often a benefit of joint training in MTL settings when a model is trained on similar tasks._

# ## Make DataLoaders

# %% [markdown]
# With our data now loaded/created, we can now package it up into `DictDataset`s for training. This object is a simple wrapper around `torch.utils.data.Dataset` and stores data fields and labels as dictionaries.
#
# In the `DictDataset`, each label corresponds to a particular `Task` by name.  We'll define these `Task` objects in the following section as we define our model.
#
# `DictDataloader` is a wrapper for `torch.utils.data.Dataloader`, which handles the collate function for `DictDataset` appropriately.

# %%

dataloaders = []
for task_name in ["circle", "square"]:
    for split, X, Y in (
        ("train", X_train, Y_train),
        ("valid", X_valid, Y_valid),
        ("test", X_test, Y_test),
    ):
        X_dict = {f"{task_name}_data": torch.FloatTensor(X[task_name])}
        Y_dict = {f"{task_name}_task": torch.LongTensor(Y[task_name])}
        dataset = DictDataset(f"{task_name}Dataset", split, X_dict, Y_dict)
        dataloader = DictDataLoader(dataset, batch_size=32)
        dataloaders.append(dataloader)

# %% [markdown]
# We now have 6 data loaders, one for each split (`train`, `valid`, `test`) of each task (`circle_task` and `square_task`).

# %% [markdown]
# ## Define Model

# %% [markdown]
# Now we'll define the `MultitaskClassifier` model, a PyTorch multi-task classifier.
# We'll instantiate it from a list of `Tasks`.

# %% [markdown]
# ### Tasks

# %% [markdown]
# A `Task` represents a path through a neural network. In `MultitaskClassifier`, this path corresponds to a particular sequence of PyTorch modules through which each data point will make a forward pass.
#
# To specify this sequence of modules, each `Task` includes a **module pool** (a set of modules that it relies on) and an **operation sequence**.
# Each [Operation](https://snorkel.readthedocs.io/en/master/packages/_autosummary/classification/snorkel.classification.Operation.html#snorkel.classification.Operation) specifies a module and the inputs that module expects.
# These inputs will come from previously executed operations or the original input (denoted with the special keyword "_input_").
# For inputs that are a dict instead of a Tensor (such as "_input_"), we include with the op name the name of a key to index with.
#
# As an example, we verbosely define the module pool and task flow for the circle task:

# %%
import torch.nn as nn
from snorkel.classification import Operation

# Define a two-layer MLP module and a one-layer prediction "head" module
base_mlp = nn.Sequential(nn.Linear(2, 8), nn.ReLU(), nn.Linear(8, 4), nn.ReLU())
head_module = nn.Linear(4, 2)

# The module pool contains all the modules this task uses
module_pool = nn.ModuleDict({"base_mlp": base_mlp, "circle_head_module": head_module})

# "From the input dictionary, pull out 'circle_data' and send it through input_module"
op1 = Operation(
    name="base_mlp", module_name="base_mlp", inputs=[("_input_", "circle_data")]
)

# "Pass the output of op1 (the MLP module) as input to the head_module"
op2 = Operation(
    name="circle_head", module_name="circle_head_module", inputs=["base_mlp"]
)

op_sequence = [op1, op2]

# %% [markdown]
# The output of the final operation will then go into a loss function to calculate the loss (e.g., cross-entropy) during training or an output function (e.g., softmax) to convert the logits into a prediction.
#
# Each `Task` also specifies which metrics it supports, which are bundled together in a `Scorer` object. For this tutorial, we'll just look at accuracy.

# %% [markdown]
# Putting this all together, we define the circle task:

# %%
from functools import partial

import torch.nn.functional as F

from snorkel.analysis import Scorer
from snorkel.classification import Task

circle_task = Task(
    name="circle_task",
    module_pool=module_pool,
    op_sequence=op_sequence,
    loss_func=F.cross_entropy,
    output_func=partial(F.softmax, dim=1),
    scorer=Scorer(metrics=["accuracy"]),
)

# %% [markdown]
# Note that `Task` objects are not dependent on a particular dataset; multiple datasets can be passed through the same modules for pre-training or co-training.

# %% [markdown]
# ### Again, but faster

# %% [markdown]
# We'll now define the square task, but more succinctlyâ€”for example, using the fact that the default name for an `Operation` is its `module_name` (since most tasks only use their modules once per forward pass).
#
# We'll also define the square task to share the first module in its task flow (`base_mlp`) with the circle task to demonstrate how to share modules. (Note that this is purely for illustrative purposes; for this toy task, it is quite possible that this is not the optimal arrangement of modules).
#
# Finally, the most common task definitions we see in practice are classification tasks with cross-entropy loss and softmax on the output of the last module, and accuracy is most often the primary metric of interest, these are all the default values, so we can drop them here for brevity.

# %%
square_task = Task(
    name="square_task",
    module_pool=nn.ModuleDict({"base_mlp": base_mlp, "square_head": nn.Linear(4, 2)}),
    op_sequence=[
        Operation("base_mlp", [("_input_", "square_data")]),
        Operation("square_head", ["base_mlp"]),
    ],
)

# %% [markdown]
# ## Model

# %% [markdown]
# With our tasks defined, constructing a model is simple: we simply pass the list of tasks in and the model constructs itself using information from the task flows.
#
# Note that the model uses the names of modules (not the modules themselves) to determine whether two modules specified by separate tasks are the same module (and should share weights) or different modules (with separate weights).
# So because both the `square_task` and `circle_task` include "base_mlp" in their module pools, this module will be shared between the two tasks.

# %%
from snorkel.classification import MultitaskClassifier

model = MultitaskClassifier([circle_task, square_task])

# %% [markdown]
# ### Train Model

# %% [markdown]
# Once the model is constructed, we can train it as we would a single-task model, using the `fit` method of a `Trainer` object. The `Trainer` supports multiple schedules or patterns for sampling from different dataloaders; the default is to randomly sample from them proportional to their number of batches, such that all data points  will be seen exactly once before any are seen twice.

# %%
from snorkel.classification import Trainer

trainer_config = {"progress_bar": False, "n_epochs": 10, "lr": 0.02}

trainer = Trainer(**trainer_config)
trainer.fit(model, dataloaders)

# %% [markdown]
# ### Evaluate model

# %% [markdown]
# After training, we can call the model.score() method to see the final performance of our trained model.

# %%
model.score(dataloaders)

# %% [markdown]
# Task-specific metrics are recorded in the form `task/dataset/split/metric` corresponding to the task the made the predictions, the dataset the predictions were made on, the split being evaluated, and the metric being calculated.
#
# For model-wide metrics (such as the total loss over all tasks or the learning rate), the default task name is `model` and the dataset name is `all` (e.g. `model/all/train/loss`).

# %% [markdown]
# # Your Turn

# %% [markdown]
# To check your understanding of how to use the multi-task `MultitaskClassifier`, see if you can add a task to this multi-task model.
#
# We'll generate the data for you (again, with a train, valid, and test split).
# Let's call it the `inv_circle_task`, since it will have the same distribution as our circle data, but with the inverted (flipped) labels.
# Intuitively, a model that is very good at telling whether a point is within a certain region should also be very good at telling if it's outside the region.
#
# By sharing some layers (the `base_mlp`), this new task will help the model to learn a representation that benefits the `circle_task` as well.
# And because it will have a non-shared layer (call it the `inv_circle_head`), it will have the flexibility to map that good representation into the right label space for its own task.

# %% [markdown]
# ### Create the data

from utils import make_inv_circle_dataset

# We flip the inequality when generating the labels so that our positive
# class is now _outside_ the circle.

(X_train["inv_circle"], Y_train["inv_circle"]) = inv_circle_train
(X_valid["inv_circle"], Y_valid["inv_circle"]) = inv_circle_valid

# ## Summary

# %% [markdown]
# In this tutorial, we demonstrated how to specify arbitrary flows through a network with multiple datasets, providing the flexiblity to easily implement design patterns such as multi-task learning. On this toy task with only two simple datasets and very simple hard parameter sharing (a shared trunk with different heads), the utility of this design may be less apparent.
# However, for more complicated network structures (e.g., slicing) or scenarios with frequent changing of the structure (e.g., due to popping new tasks on/off a massive MTL model), the flexibility of this design starts to shine.
# If there's an MTL network you'd like to build but can't figure out how to represent, post an issue and let us know!
